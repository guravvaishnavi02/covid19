                <h5>
                    <p> Coronaviruses are a big family of different viruses. Some of them cause the common cold in people. Others infect animals, including bats, camels, and cattle. But how did SARS-CoV-2, the new coronavirus that causes COVID-19, come into
                        being? Here’s what we know about the virus that was first detected in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 and has set off a global pandemic
                    </p><br>
                </h5>

                <h3>Where Did the Coronavirus Come From?</h3><br>
                <h5>
                    <p>Experts say SARS-CoV-2 originated in bats. That’s also how the coronaviruses behind Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) got started. SARS-CoV-2 made the jump to humans at one of Wuhan’s
                        open-air “wet markets.” They’re where customers buy fresh meat and fish, including animals that are killed on the spot.
                    </p><br>

                    <p> Some wet markets sell wild or banned species like cobras, wild boars, and raccoon dogs. Crowded conditions can let viruses from different animals swap genes. Sometimes the virus changes so much it can start to infect and spread among
                        people. Still, the Wuhan market didn’t sell bats at the time of the outbreak. That’s why early suspicion also fell on pangolins, also called scaly anteaters, which are sold illegally in some markets in China. Some coronaviruses
                        that infect pangolins are similar to SARS-CoV-2.
                    </p><br>

                    <p>As SARS-CoV-2 spread both inside and outside China, it infected people who have had no direct contact with animals. That meant the virus is transmitted from one human to another. It’s now spreading in the U.S. and around the globe,
                        meaning that people are unwittingly catching and passing on the coronavirus. This growing worldwide transmission is what is now a pandemic.
                    </p>

                    <p>Do you know how many people have recovered and come back home safely?</p>
                </h5>
                <h2>26390584!</h2>

                <p>Yes, almost 93% of the total infected cases recovered and lived normally after fighting against Covid-19.They believed they could fight and they did. Let us learn about the basic things you can do at your home to save yourself from this
                    pandemic.
                </p><br>

                <h1>Basic things to protect ourselves</h1><br>
                <h2>Vitamin C</h2>
                <p>People are taking vitamin C in hopes of speeding their recovery, but there is no convincing scientific evidence that it works for this virus. However, taking a nominal amount of Vitamin does not harm your body and will protect against
                    immune system deficiencies, cardiovascular disease, prenatal health problems, eye disease and even skin wrinkling.</p><br>

                <h2>Vitamin D</h2>
                <p>There is some evidence to suggest that vitamin D might work like a vaccine against certain viruses. A meta-analysis found that people who took vitamin D supplements, particularly those with low nutrient levels in their bodies. We're less
                    likely to come down with acute respiratory tract infections than those who did not take it.</p><br>

                <h2>Herbs Supplements</h2>
                <p>Herbs and spices such as garlic, ginger, echinacea and turmeric have long been used to treat infections. Garlic contains allicin, a compound that helps immune cells fight off microbial invaders. In addition, it can support good gut bacteria,
                    which supports the immune system, but we should not go consuming massive amounts!</p><br>

                <h2>Breathing Exercises</h2>
                <p>Deep breathing can help restore diaphragm function and increase lung capacity. Breathing exercises like deep breathing while on your back, stomach, while sitting while standing, yawning to smile & humming will help you play a significant
                    role in the COVID-19 recovery process.<br>
                </p>

                <h1>Why vaccination is important?</h1><br>
                <p>Although experts are still learning a lot about the COVID-19 vaccines, there are some clear benefits to getting vaccinated if you have already received the vaccine, great job! Share these facts with others who might be hesitant.</p>
                <p>
                    If you are unsure whether the vaccine is right for you, consider these four benefits the vaccine could provide you and your loved ones: The vaccine reduces your risk of infection. The vaccine can help your unborn baby or newborn. The vaccine protects
                    against severe illness. By choosing to be vaccinated, you can protect not only yourself and your family but your community as well.
                </p><br>

                <h1>Upcoming Vaccines</h1>
                <p>At this time, SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are injectable. In addition, several vaccine manufacturers have started the initial development of a nasal vaccine spray; the nasal spray vaccine could be available as soon as 2022; however, this is highly
                    variable based on clinical efficacy and vaccine effectiveness in clinical trials. Of the 13 companies working on a nasal spray vaccine, five are in early clinical trials.
                </p>
                <p>Five companies around the globe are developing oral vaccines and two of these companies have moved on to phase 1 clinical trial.</p><br>

                <h1>Spread of Misinformation</h1>
                <p>Acting on the wrong information can kill. In the first 3 months of 2020, nearly 6 000 people around the globe were hospitalized because of coronavirus misinformation, recent research suggests. During this period, researchers say at least
                    800 people may have died due to misinformation related to COVID-19.</p>
                <p>Although the infodemic cannot be stopped, it can be managed through campaigns and collaborations. By showing people how to recognize and report misinformation and improve their media literacy, we can turn the tide on the infodemic tsunami
                    and save lives.</p><br>
